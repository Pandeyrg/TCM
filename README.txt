1-  q1 , q2a, q2b, q3 are the files which contain the final submissions.
2 - mixGaussEm.m has an implementation of EM algorithm used in the q3.m


###########

run q1.m for Question1 

##############33

for Question 2

the first part showing the trade off between success rate and encoding load is shown in q2a.m
the second part has the implementation of the optimal schedule
through out q2a.m  , q2b.m  we have sampled delta from mixture of two gaussians.


########################3

for Question 3
 
run q3.m

it implements EM algorithm to learnt the parameters of the bimodal distribution delta is being sampled from.
